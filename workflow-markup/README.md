# Pendo Analytics Workflow
A text repository for storing workflows and tutorials. Just about every project
links back to this repository to explain why it is the way it is. I encourage you
to read workflow.txt before jumping into the tutorials.

The traning references are in order. To get started I suggest you go through them as follows:
1. workflow.md
2. gettingstarted.md
3. reference.md

Here you can find files with examples in context:
1. [Airflow workflow beginning to end - Coming Soon]()
